## ILL conservative reach — wrapped up 2026-10-07 (dylan-MS-7C84)

**Status: done.** Write-up `ill/FEASIBILITY_SIM.md` §10–12; deck `ill/deck/build_deck.py` → live at
https://dylan-neff.web.cern.ch/notes/ill-x17-feasibility.html (slide 4 “Verdict”). No condor jobs pending.

**Result:** n_TOF hardware + ≤3° MM segments + 20° collinearity veto (no panel) + CFRP end cap → 1.2e-2
(3σ, 50 d). Accidentals left = Be window + air only; IPC floor 6.2e-3. In ⁸Be units: ×7.5 as is, ×3.8 with
zero background, ×2.7 for the 200 ps floor. Unpolarised, one cycle cannot reach ⁸Be's level.

**Follow-ups (none started):**
1. Theory: ask Viviani et al. for X17/γ at E_n ≈ 25 meV (hindered thermal M1 decides above/below ⁸Be).
2. Polarised ³He at PF1B (Tyrex-type cell + polarised beam): E0 suppression and J^π. Cell compatibility,
   polarisation, lifetime in beam.
3. Simulate the levers in `ill/sim/lxplus/conservative.py --budget`: an E0-removed oracle (floor ÷ ~1.6
   estimate) and an efficiency/containment scan (×4 containment → ÷ ~2 estimate).

**Gotchas:** local `python3` has no pandas; build the deck with
`~/PycharmProjects/nTof_x17/.venv/bin/python ill/deck/build_deck.py`. Publish with
`python3 ~/PycharmProjects/dylan-cern-site/scripts/add-note.py ill/out/feasibility_deck.html --slug ill-x17-feasibility --force --deploy`.
Heavy work only as condor jobs; C1w jobs need ~14 GB. Scripts run from `/afs/cern.ch/work/d/dneff/git/x17_ill/analysis/`.

## trigger_scint — big-slab backgrounds at the ILL — updated 2026-10-02 (dylan-MS-7C84)

**Goal:** decide whether a large, thick (H-rich) trigger slab drowns the ILL
pair search in background, compared with the detector as built (P2 70×70×2,
P5 75×75×5, P5L/P5B = P5 + 2 mm ⁶LiF/B₄C wrap). The answer goes in
`trigger_scint/BACKGROUNDS.md`. Full run log: `trigger_scint/STATUS.md`
("Session 2" and "Session 2 restart").

**Done:**
- All TB Geant4 runs finished. Analysis done for asbuilt (air ×1, ×0.1) and P2.
  JSONs are in `trigger_scint/sim/bkg/`, and `bkg_figs.py` has been run on them.
- P2 result: no better than as built at Esum > 13 MeV (timing reach 1.6e-2 vs
  8.4e-3). That is expected: a 2 cm slab has as-built signal acceptance.
- Restart at 18:30: released the held P5_C1w reductions at 40 GB, and dropped
  4 truncated raw files (merged partially with `merge_partial.sh`).

**In progress / where it stopped (on lxplus926, nohup):**
- `x17_trig/pipeline_tb.sh`: P5L/P5B C1w reductions running (condor 4354874,
  4354876, 42 GB). P5_C1w reduction (4354038) has left the queue and should
  merge on the next pass.
- `x17_trig/analysis/run_bkg.sh P5 P5L P5B`: each geometry starts once its
  `.merged` markers exist and takes ~40 min. Output:
  `/eos/experiment/ntof/data/x17/ill/TB/analysis/{P5,P5L,P5B}[_air0.1].json`
  and `.log`.
- Expected done ~20:30–21:00 on 2026-10-02.

**Next steps:**
1. Check that the outputs exist. If the drivers died, restart them (commands
   in STATUS.md) and check `condor_q dneff -hold`.
2. `scp lxplus:/eos/experiment/ntof/data/x17/ill/TB/analysis/P5*.json trigger_scint/sim/bkg/`,
   then run `python trigger_scint/bkg_figs.py`.
3. Compare P2/P5/P5L/P5B with as built: reach vs gate G, trigger rates, MM
   occupancy, budget.
4. Write `trigger_scint/BACKGROUNDS.md`. Include the unsimulated hall-γ
   caveat (STATUS.md). Update README and the TRIGGER_OPTIONS recommendation,
   then log it on the x17 board.

**Gotchas / decisions:**
- C1w reductions need ~36 GB. The pipeline now asks 40 GB.
- The truncated raw files (P5_C1 job008, P5_K1 jobs 003/024/032) were not
  rerun. The merge normalises by summed N.sim, so they cost statistics only.
  `pipeline_tb.sh` keeps looping on those two directories, which is harmless.
- `lxplus989` and `lxplus926` can't be reached by name (host key); use `ssh lxplus` and work from AFS.

**Key files & commands:**
- `trigger_scint/bkg_reach.py` — reach model with pile-up (runs on lxplus).
- `trigger_scint/bkg_figs.py` — figures and tables from `sim/bkg/*.json`.
- `trigger_scint/sim/lxplus/{submit_tb,pipeline_tb,merge_partial,run_bkg}.sh` — copies of the lxplus drivers.

## ILL rate vs DREAM dead time — updated 2026-10-02 (dylan-MS-7C84)

**Goal:** check whether the DREAM DAQ, which reads full Micromegas waveforms for the
TPC tracking, limits the usable ILL absorbed rate. Dylan feared it would change
the reach by orders of magnitude.

**Done (analysis only; no change to the feasibility code yet):**
- **DREAM limits**, from `~/PycharmProjects/nTof_x17_DAQ/docs/REPORT_2026-07-28_pulser_daq_characterization.md`,
  `DAQ_OPTIMIZATION_SUMMARY_2026-07-23.md`, `CLOCK_RATE_SCAN_2026-07-23.md`,
  `CLOCK_WINDOW_RESULT_2026-07-24.md` and `METHOD_readout_window_optimization.md`:
  - The ceiling is ~83 MB/s **per FEU**, wire-limited. It is not set by IPD, host, network or disk.
  - RAW production point (20 samples × 60 ns = 1.2 µs, Hwm 1): **3.35 kHz max, τ ≈ 298 µs** per event.
    Readout is non-paralysable, one event at a time, so live = 1/(1 + f·τ).
  - τ scales linearly with the number of samples.
  - ZS reached 10.8 kHz at 32 samples on the pulser. ZS at real occupancy is unmeasured, and the
    `PedSub` double-subtraction question is still open.
  - The 20-sample window holds 95 % of the drift charge at 700 V drift.
- **Trigger rate per 10¹⁰ absorbed n/s**, G5 tables, from `ill/sim/trig_ladder.py`:

  | trigger | rate | X17 kept |
  |---|---|---|
  | bare SiPM 0.5 MIP, both arms | 5.6 kHz | 100 % |
  | + ≥ 1 plastic (n_TOF-like menu) | ~1.1 kHz | 99 % |
  | + plastic in both arms | ~110 Hz | 66 % |
  | arm energy > 1 MeV, each arm | 1.2 kHz | 95 % |
  | arm energy > 2 MeV, each arm | ~120 Hz | 91 % |
  | sum of the two arms > 8 MeV | ≲ 110 Hz | 100 % |

- **Live fraction** (cosmics ~16 Hz added):
  - 2 MeV per-arm threshold: 0.97 at 0.9e10 n/s, 0.93 at 1.9e10, with the 1.2 µs window.
  - Same threshold, 4.8 µs window: 0.87 and 0.78.
  - Bare SiPM trigger, 1.2 µs window: 0.40 and 0.24.
  - The n_TOF-like menu: ~0.78 at 0.9e10.
  - All fitted components scale with live time, so reach ∝ 1/√live.
- **Conclusion:** DREAM costs an O(1) factor, not orders of magnitude, as long as the hardware
  trigger cuts on arm energy at ~2 MeV.
  - With that cut: ~2 % in reach (1.2 µs window), ~7 % (4.8 µs).
  - Worst case, a bare trigger at 1.2 µs: ~×1.6 in reach.

**In progress / where it stopped:** answered in chat; not yet written into `ill/FEASIBILITY_SIM.md`.
That file and `ill/README.md` have uncommitted edits from another session, so they were left untouched.
Open question to Dylan: what drift window the ILL TPC needs (the study only went to 4.8 µs).

**Next steps:**
1. Add a DREAM live-time factor to `ill/sim_feasibility.py` `model()`: τ = 298 µs × n_samples/20,
   trigger rate per absorbed n from the menu. Then re-optimise the rate and redo `scan_v1`.
2. Run a larger **unbiased** C1 sample on lxplus to measure the trigger rate above 2 MeV per arm.
   It currently rests on one unit-weight Monte Carlo row.
3. In `ill/ill_rates.py`, set `DREAM_MAX_HZ` from 1e3 to the measured 3.35 kHz (RAW, 20 samples),
   scaled by n_samples.
4. Write it up as a new §10 in `FEASIBILITY_SIM.md`, plus a slide in the deck (`ill/deck/build_deck.py`).

**Gotchas / decisions:**
- The 5.5 kHz in FEASIBILITY_SIM §2 is the SiPM-only menu. It is not a realistic ILL trigger.
- A plastic-in-both-arms trigger loses 34 % of X17, because the leptons often miss the plastic.
  Use arm energy (sum of the arm's scintillators) or a two-arm sum instead.
- The ILL hall's ambient γ and fast-neutron rate is unknown (`ill/FACILITY.md`). It could raise the
  low-threshold singles above the Monte Carlo.

**Key files & commands:**
- `cd ill && PYTHONPATH=. python sim/trig_ladder.py` — the trigger ladder (uses local
  `sim/contracts/C1_G5` and `sim/s1test/G5_X17`)
- `ill/sim_feasibility.py` — reach model (no DAQ live time yet)
- `ill/beam_spot.py` — beam rate vs spot diameter (Ø2 cm ≈ 1.9e10 n/s)

## he4_bag — ³He cell skin choice (Al foil) — updated 2026-10-02 (dylan-MS-7C84)

**Goal:** choose a 1 bar ³He cell skin that stops ³He permeation without adding neutron-capture
background or lepton scattering. Dylan's questions: alternatives to Al, the thinnest foil, what the
scattering "base" is, and whether 1 bar needs any strength.

**Done (analytic; published):**
- `he4_bag/he4_bag.py` §6 (metals, foil_gauge, chord_budget, hoop) → `he4_bag/out/{metals,foil_gauge,chord_budget,chord_ladder,hoop}.csv`.
- Slides 11–15 added to the note, republished at https://dylan-neff.web.cern.ch/notes/ill-he4-bag-3he-leak.html.
- `he4_bag/README.md` §6; pointers in `ill/FEASIBILITY_SIM.md` §5 and §9, `ill/README.md`, and the `vessel_design/mylar_wrap_vessel.py` docstring.
- Results:
  - The skin is already outside the beam (R 40 mm vs r99 12.9 mm) and adds ~1e-8 captures/n.
  - The Al that matters is the 8 mm end caps: upstream cap + ring are in 63 % of G1 accidentals.
  - Al is the right metal (only Be is better, and it can't be wrapped).
  - Skin: 12 µm PET + 6–7 µm converter foil, no PE sealant.
  - Scattering base: Micromegas 9 µm Cu 39 %, air 33 %, skin 8 %.
  - ±50 mbar is fine with the PET as the load layer. The cell can't be pumped out to fill it.

**Next steps:**
1. Geant4 (ILL branch of MX17_Full_Geant, lxplus): run C1 on G1 with the laminate skin. This needs a
   two-layer `--skin`; `Al:0.007` alone gives a bound.
2. Geant4: run G1 with the upstream Al cap lined with ⁶LiF, or trimmed, then rerun `ill/sim/lxplus/acc_sources.py`.
3. Check that the 9 µm Cu in the Micromegas entrance is the drift cathode, and whether it can be aluminised.
4. Bench-leak-test a short PET/Al prototype with a He leak detector.

**Gotchas / decisions:**
- Pinhole densities, thinnest foils and yields are catalogue-level (order of magnitude). The barrel
  crossing rate (1e-4/n) is analytic.
- Neither run is set up yet.

**Key files & commands:**
- `python3 he4_bag/he4_bag.py && python3 he4_bag/make_he4_bag_deck.py`
- `python3 ~/PycharmProjects/dylan-cern-site/scripts/add-note.py he4_bag/out/he4_bag_deck.html --slug ill-he4-bag-3he-leak --force --deploy`
