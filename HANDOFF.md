## trigger_scint — big-slab backgrounds at the ILL — updated 2026-10-02 (dylan-MS-7C84)

**Goal:** decide whether a large, thick (H-rich) trigger slab drowns the ILL
pair search in background, compared with the detector as built (P2 70×70×2,
P5 75×75×5, P5L/P5B = P5 + 2 mm ⁶LiF/B₄C wrap). The answer goes in
`trigger_scint/BACKGROUNDS.md`. Full run log: `trigger_scint/STATUS.md`
("Session 2" and "Session 2 restart").

**Done:**
- All TB Geant4 runs finished. Analysis done for asbuilt (air ×1, ×0.1) and P2.
  JSONs are in `trigger_scint/sim/bkg/`, and `bkg_figs.py` has been run on them.
- P2 result: no better than as built at Esum > 13 MeV (timing reach 1.6e-2 vs
  8.4e-3). That is expected: a 2 cm slab has as-built signal acceptance.
- Restart at 18:30: released the held P5_C1w reductions at 40 GB, and dropped
  4 truncated raw files (merged partially with `merge_partial.sh`).

**In progress / where it stopped (on lxplus926, nohup):**
- `x17_trig/pipeline_tb.sh`: P5L/P5B C1w reductions running (condor 4354874,
  4354876, 42 GB). P5_C1w reduction (4354038) has left the queue and should
  merge on the next pass.
- `x17_trig/analysis/run_bkg.sh P5 P5L P5B`: each geometry starts once its
  `.merged` markers exist and takes ~40 min. Output:
  `/eos/experiment/ntof/data/x17/ill/TB/analysis/{P5,P5L,P5B}[_air0.1].json`
  and `.log`.
- Expected done ~20:30–21:00 on 2026-10-02.

**Next steps:**
1. Check that the outputs exist. If the drivers died, restart them (commands
   in STATUS.md) and check `condor_q dneff -hold`.
2. `scp lxplus:/eos/experiment/ntof/data/x17/ill/TB/analysis/P5*.json trigger_scint/sim/bkg/`,
   then run `python trigger_scint/bkg_figs.py`.
3. Compare P2/P5/P5L/P5B with as built: reach vs gate G, trigger rates, MM
   occupancy, budget.
4. Write `trigger_scint/BACKGROUNDS.md`. Include the unsimulated hall-γ
   caveat (STATUS.md). Update README and the TRIGGER_OPTIONS recommendation,
   then log it on the x17 board.

**Gotchas / decisions:**
- C1w reductions need ~36 GB. The pipeline now asks 40 GB.
- The truncated raw files (P5_C1 job008, P5_K1 jobs 003/024/032) were not
  rerun. The merge normalises by summed N.sim, so they cost statistics only.
  `pipeline_tb.sh` keeps looping on those two directories, which is harmless.
- `lxplus989` and `lxplus926` can't be reached by name (host key); use `ssh lxplus` and work from AFS.

**Key files & commands:**
- `trigger_scint/bkg_reach.py` — reach model with pile-up (runs on lxplus).
- `trigger_scint/bkg_figs.py` — figures and tables from `sim/bkg/*.json`.
- `trigger_scint/sim/lxplus/{submit_tb,pipeline_tb,merge_partial,run_bkg}.sh` — copies of the lxplus drivers.
